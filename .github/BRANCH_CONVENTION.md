# Git Branch Name Convention

> This invented by myself and if you have a better idea, pls feel free to contribute

## TL;DR:

Branch name should follow the pattern

```
<keyword>/<issue-number>/<short-description>

where keyword is one from this list feat|fix|polish|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|ci|chore|types
```

## Examples

Branch that add this stuff with a naming convention should looks like this:

```
docs/<issue-number>/add-branch-convention
```
